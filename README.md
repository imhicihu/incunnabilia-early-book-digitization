# Rationale [![Bitbucket issues](https://img.shields.io/badge/issues-open-green.svg)]()

This repository shows the process-workflow of digitization of an _incunabulae_.

### What is this repository for? ###

* _Process-workflow-description_ turning a book and becoming a _digital asset_. 
* Version 1.3

### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up
    * Implies [hardware and software](https://bitbucket.org/imhicihu/incunnabilia-early-book-digital/issues/1/hardware-camera-lens): camera, lens, lux control, image editors, creation of custom profiles (for optimization and a smooth workflow between hardware & software), etc.
    * Gathering of data of possible-scenarios/environment or even better: leading cases (through forums, digital libraries, bibliography, etc.). Hence, a private repository of bibliography will _become_ an objective.
    * There is a Bibliography section (in progress). Can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/imhicihu/incunnabilia-early-book-digitization/src/b13740330d22c031dab8f8cd69bde3b73baf8ac9/Biblioteca_Congreso.md?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default)
    * There is a Links section. Can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/imhicihu/incunnabilia-early-book-digitization/src/9219cd057c533589234365b3669c32e016ba01bf/Links.md?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default)
* Configuration
    * Up to now, in the process of gathering data to meet international norms. It a _mixture_ between hardware & software
* Dependencies
    * The same nature of the process, needs lots of steps to meet consecutively
* How to run tests
    * No data to share (up to now)
* Deployment instructions
    * No data to share (up to now)
