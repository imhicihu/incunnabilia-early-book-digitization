      * Lesson 4.6: Considerations for delicate and heritage documents: management of risk and how to avoid their deterioration: before, during, after digitization.
      * (...) Researches should be involved in your work as well: they will probably show an interest in the project and could warn about problems resulting from inappropiate handling.
      * (...) The biggest enemy of delicate materials is the change of environmental conditions. This happens when you move the materials from a stable storage environment to your digitization centre. The materials may then change their original form, for example, physical modifications and movement of parchments may result in the accelerated embrittlement of the acid paper. (...) ensure appropiate climate control during transportation. (...) The temperature and relative humidity at the digitization centre should be the same as at the permanent storage environment. You should also avoid exposure of digitized materials to additional sources of heat and light.
      * (...) And important aspect to be considered is light control. During the scanning process, the materials are exposed to heat and light for a rather long period of time. You should minimize the heat exposure in this case.
      * (...) Place special infrared protection foil between the lights and the exposed material. 
      * (...) Place small ventilators behind the lights. The air will take the heat out of this space. 
      * (...) For transporation back to remote repositories, take the same security and climate control measures as you did during transportation for digitization. Use the digitization-relate care period for the introduction of additional preservation methods, try to improve the storage of originals (...) by the use of protective boxes made with acid-free milboard paper or use protective permanent paper envelopes.

      * (...) The project required detailed bibligraphical preparation, selection, verification, and intense tracking of materiales 
      * (...) LB catalogers, working from the original Freimann Library catalog, worked through the titles that was identified as missing 
      * (...) the process ensured not only the selection of materials but also their full descriptive cataloging which was required before digitization took place (p. 226)
      * (...) Photographers while not particularly vulnerable overall  as objects, made them more vulnerable for photography in particular. For example, condition issues such as brittleness and tight margins necessitated the removal of a selection of books from the original list. (p. 227)
      * (...) This international project is an excellent case study for the reconstruction of cultrural heritage by digitally unifying resources hat have been physically scattered across the globe due to world events. 
      * (...) Collaborative, themed digital portal are on the one hand important technical tools to reconstruct collections and on the other hand important research tools to promote humanities and cultural content in context to existing and new audiences.(p. 228)

      * (...) Similarly, four image formats namely master image (TIFF format), clean image (TIFF format), access image (JPEG format) and thumbnail image (JPEG format) (p. 245)
      * (...) quality assurances is performed on all master images and their derivatives with regard to size and resolution of image, file format, image mode, bit depth, tonal values, brightness, contrast, sharpness, interference, orientation, missing lines or pixel, text legibility, cropped and border areas, etc. (p. 245)
      * (...) For each digitized manuscripts two sets of metadata are created namely subject metadata and technical metadata. (p. 245)
      * (...) Technical metadata is automatically generated and assigned to the image file  at the time of creation and the data elements covered are: file name, date created,  date modified, equipment used, image format, width, height,  colour mode, etc. (p. 245)
